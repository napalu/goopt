## Why goopt? More Than Just Parsing

`goopt` stands out by providing built-in solutions for the complex challenges of modern CLI development.

### üåê Low-Config Internationalization (i18n)
Ship a single binary that speaks your users' language. `goopt` provides out-of-the-box i18n for all system messages and a powerful code generation tool (`goopt-i18n-gen`) to automate the entire translation workflow for your application.
<br/>*[Read the Internationalization Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/v2/guides/06-internationalization/)*

### üöÄ An Advanced, Interactive Help System
Stop writing boilerplate help text. `goopt` features an **adaptive help system** that automatically chooses the best display style for your CLI's complexity. Its interactive parser lets users search and filter help (`--help --search "db"`), providing a superior experience.

### ‚úÖ Powerful, Composable Validation
Define complex validation rules directly in your struct tags. Chain built-in validators like `email`, `port`, and `range`, or compose them with logical operators (`oneof`, `all`, `not`) to ensure your application receives correct data.
<br/>*[See the Validation Guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/v2/guides/04-advanced-features/01-validation/)*

### ÌõÖ Command Lifecycle Hooks
Implement cross-cutting concerns cleanly with a powerful pre- and post-execution hook system. Manage authentication, database connections, logging, and resource cleanup with ease by attaching logic to the command lifecycle.
